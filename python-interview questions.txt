1) what is python?

- Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It's widely used in web development, software development, data science, and machine learning. 

2) what are the data types in python ?

- float, str, list, tuple, dict, set, bool, and NoneType. 

3) difference between list & tuples ?

- List: Ordered, mutable. 
- Tuple: Ordered, immutable. 
- Set: Unordered, no duplicates, mutable.
- Dictionary: Key-value pairs, mutable.

4) what are python decorators?

- decorators are basically python function to modify the behavior of other functions or methods.

5) difference between set and dictionary?

- set : unordered, mutable, stores unique data
- disctionary : stores data in key value pair, mutable

6) what's deep copy and shallow copy ?
- Shallow copy copies references of nested objects.
- deep copy recursively copies all objects.

7) what's oops in python?

- it's a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to structure code. it allows developers to model real-world entities and their interactions using programming concepts.

8) difference between function and method?

- Functions are independent blocks of code that can be called from anywhere
- while methods are tied to objects or classes and need an object or class instance to be invoked

9) How to shuffle list? list manupulation/list comprehension ?

- list shuffle is to modify or change the place of the existing elements inside a list.
we can use two functions here random.shuffle() - it shuffles the original list. 
random.sample() - it makes a shuffled copy of the original list elements where as keep the original list value same.

- List comprehension is not used for direct shuffling, but can be used to create a shuffled copy or perform operations after shuffling.  

10) how to reverse string?

- by using slicing method.

string="Hello"
reversed_string=string[::-1]
print(reversed_string)

11) Stack & queue?
-Stacks and queues are simple data structures that allow us to store and retrieve data sequentially. In a stack, the last item we enter is the first to come out. In a queue, the first item we enter is the first come out. We can add items to a stack using the push operation and retrieve items using the pop operation.

Push: Adds a new element on the stack.
Pop: Removes and returns the top element from the stack.
Peek: Returns the top element on the stack.
isEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.
Size: Finds the number of elements in the stack.

1) What is django?
-A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean,
pragmatic design.

2) what is ORM and what are the features of it ?
-n Django, an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) is a powerful tool that acts as an intermediary between Python code and relational databases.
or 
-The Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) is a powerful feature that allows developers to interact with databases using Python code rather than writing raw SQL queries

3) What is MVT? and it's features ?

4) What's JWT?
-JWT (JSON Web Token) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact, self-contained way to securely transmit information between parties as a JSON object. 
-It consists of three parts:
Header (algorithm and token type)
Payload (claims/data)
Signature (verification)


5) Difference between staticmethod and dynamicmethod ?
-@staticmethod : doesnâ€™t access class or instance.
-@classmethod : takes class ( cls ) as first
argument.

6) what is jinja ?
